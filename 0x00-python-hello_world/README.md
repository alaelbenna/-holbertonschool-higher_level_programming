## 0x00. Python - Hello, World

# What is Python?

* Python is a general-purpose programming language created by Guido Van Rossum. Python is most praised for its elegant syntax and readable code, if you are just beginning your programming career Python suits you best. With Python you can do everything from GUI development, Web application, System administration tasks, Financial calculation, Data Analysis, Visualization and list goes on.

# Python is an interpreted language

* Yes, Python is interpreted language, when you run python program an interpreter will parse python program line by line basis, as compared to compiled languages like C or C++, where compiler first compiles the program and then start running.

* Now you may ask, so what's the difference??

* The difference is that interpreted languages are a little bit slow as compared to compiled languages. Yes, you will definitely get some performance benefits if you write your code in compiled languages like C or C++.

* But writing codes in such languages is a daunting task for a beginner. Also in such languages, you need to write even most basic functions like calculate the length of the array, split the string etc. For more advanced tasks sometimes you need to create your own data structures to encapsulate data in the program. So in C/C++ before you actually start solving your business problem you need to take care of all minor details. This is where Python comes. In Python, you don't need to define any data structure, no need to define small utility functions because Python has everything to get you started.
